## Main Differenz
### The Main Differenz is, that File.ca is static, and FileData.ca not, so since we know this, let's Code something with this!

```cs

FileData Learning;
public void Write()
{
Learning = new FileData();
Learning.path = @"C:/Saves/LearningData.txt", "Welcome here!");
File.write(@"C:/Saves/Learning.txt", "Hello!");
}
```
### That were the Main Stuff! Easy, right?
