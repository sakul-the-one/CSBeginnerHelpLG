# The Box.cs File now! Here we go!
## The Box.cs File is not harder then File.ca and FileData.cs, it's very easy!
Let's Beginn with the functions!
```cs
public void Say-Something(){
Box.say("I wanna to say something"); //Very fast to say something!
```
## Easy like always, right???
The Reason why I made this class, is because on that way it's faster then the normal Class from Windows, hope you are now on more Speed!
Let's ask some Questions, right?
